# BH-PCMLAI-Module_17
This project contains the Module 17 practical application assignment III and activities files.

# Overview
This assignment aims to compare the performance of different classifiers, including K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, through a practical application. To achieve this goal, we will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The dataset is derived from a Portugese banking institution and consists of the outcomes of multiple marketing campaigns.


# summary of findings
In this study, my goal was to identify the most effective classifier for a marketing bank products dataset to optimize the bank's marketing strategies and increase campaign success rates. The baseline model accuracy was 0.89, and a simple model had a training time of 0.360 seconds and a test accuracy of 0.91. Additionally, the precision, recall, and F1 score were 0.669, 0.405, and 0.504, respectively. To improve the model, I performed PCA and GridSearchCV for all the models and found that the decision tree model had the best accuracy while also having a reasonable execution time.

## Reccomendations
Given the finding and additional observations my recomendation is to focuse on the decision tree model and further optimize it.
